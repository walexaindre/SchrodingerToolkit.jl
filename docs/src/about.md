# Why did I create this package?

I am pursuing a Master's degree in Scientific Computing and aim to become proficient in developing numerical methods for solving PDEs. This package is part of my research work, focusing on numerical methods for solving nonlinear Schr√∂dinger equations. Additionally, I am interested in parallelizing these methods using GPUs. This work represents a good attempt to parallelize the solution to the aforementioned problem using GPUs. The idea behind this arose from the need to perform larger simulations in a reasonable amount of time with specialized hardware.
