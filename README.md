## Acknowledgments

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the University of Puerto Rico for providing the resources, support, and an enriching academic environment throughout my studies. The guidance and expertise of my professors and colleagues have been invaluable to the development of this research. 

Special thanks to Mathematical Sciences Department for their continued support and to the faculty members who have inspired me to push the boundaries of my knowledge. I also appreciate the technical and administrative staff whose contributions have made my work easier and more efficient.

Without the opportunities provided by the University of Puerto Rico, this work would not have been possible.
